# My Laptop setup to work with Windows 10

This are some tweaks I use to increase the performance and the durability of my notebook. I don't encourage anyone to use them ;).

* [Disable Windows Defender Virus Protection via Group Policy](disable-windows-defender.reg)
* [Disable writing of random patterns to the memory (in background), to test the memory](disable-memtest.ps1)
* [Disable automatic Windows Update reboots, as long as users are logged in](no-reboot-with-logged-in-users.reg)
